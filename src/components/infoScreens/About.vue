        Probably write something here about how it is best used as an aide to
        help keep track of things for the DM, but not to let it ruin the flow of
        the game. Help to keep players involved by making sure everyone gets a
        chance to do something, but don't let it get in the way. This isn't a
        replacement for an initiative tracker either in games that use those.
